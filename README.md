# Bewakoof Website Frontend

This project is a React.js implementation of the frontend for the Bewakoof website. The goal of this project is to replicate the design and functionality of the Bewakoof homepage using React.js and modern frontend technologies.

## Features

- **Dynamic Components**: Reusable React components for different sections of the website.
- **Styled with CSS**: Custom styling using CSS modules to maintain a modular and scalable approach.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implementation of interactive elements such as carousels, modals, and buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS Modules**: For scoped and modular styling.
- **React Router**: For routing between different sections of the site (if applicable).
